Python/PyTorch codes to plot the numerical simulations appearing in the paper "Double Trouble in Double Descent: Bias and Variance(s) in the Lazy Regime"

1. Numerical simulations of the effect of ensembling on random feature models: use ensembling_random_features.ipynb.

2. Numerical simulation on real neural networks in the lazy regime:  use run.py to generate the data (assumes slurm and pytorch are installed), then plot.ipynb to plot the figure in the main text.
